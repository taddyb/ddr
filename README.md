# Distributed Differentiable Routing (DDR)

An implementation of differentiable river routing methods for the NextGen Framework and Hydrofabric

[![Ruff](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/astral-sh/ruff/main/assets/badge/v2.json)](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff)

### Installation

DDR uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management. From the repo root:

```sh
# Full workspace — CPU (includes ddr, ddr-engine, and ddr-benchmarks)
uv sync --all-packages

# Or core DDR only (skip engine and benchmarks)
uv sync --package ddr

# GPU support (adds CuPy for CUDA 12.4)
uv sync --all-packages --group cuda12

# GPU support (adds CuPy for CUDA 13.0)
uv sync --all-packages --group cuda13
```

This installs the `ddr` CLI entry point. Verify with `ddr --help`.

### Quick Start

1. **Copy a config template** from `config/templates/` and customize paths:
   ```sh
   cp config/templates/merit_training.yaml config/my_training.yaml
   # Edit config/my_training.yaml — set data_sources paths to your data
   ```

   Templates use `${oc.env:DDR_DATA_DIR,./data}` so you can set the
   `DDR_DATA_DIR` environment variable or edit the paths directly.

2. **Train a model** using the `ddr` CLI:
   ```sh
   ddr train --config-name=my_training
   ```

3. **Evaluate** the trained model:
   ```sh
   ddr test --config-name=my_testing
   ```

Available subcommands: `train`, `test`, `route`, `train-and-test`, `summed-q-prime`.

You can also call scripts directly if preferred:
```sh
uv run python scripts/train.py --config-name=my_training
```

4. **Generate geometry predictions** from a trained checkpoint:
   ```sh
   uv run python scripts/geometry_predictor.py --config-name=merit_geometry_config
   ```
   This predicts KAN parameters (n, p, q) for all MERIT reaches and computes
   trapezoidal geometry statistics (depth, top width, bottom width, side slope,
   hydraulic radius) using real accumulated discharge over a water year.
   CONUS reaches get full geometry stats; non-CONUS reaches get KAN parameters only.
   Output is a NetCDF file. Override the water year with:
   ```sh
   uv run python scripts/geometry_predictor.py --config-name=merit_geometry_config \
       experiment.start_time=2001/10/01 experiment.end_time=2002/09/30
   ```

### Data Engine

Before training, you need to create adjacency matrices for your domain:
- Requires the `ddr-engine` local package (installed automatically by `uv sync --all-packages`)
- The gauges.csv can be found [here](https://github.com/DeepGroundwater/references/tree/master/mhpi/dHBV2.0UH)

```sh
uv run python engine/scripts/build_hydrofabric_v2.2_matrices.py <PATH/TO/conus_nextgen.gpkg> data/ --gages references/mhpi/dHBV2.0UH/training_gauges.csv
```

This creates two files used for routing:
- `hydrofabric_v2.2_conus_adjacency.zarr` — sparse COO matrix of the full CONUS river network
- `hydrofabric_v2.2_gages_conus_adjacency.zarr` — zarr.Group of sparse COO matrices for networks upstream of USGS gauges

### Pre-trained Examples

The `examples/` directory contains pre-trained weights and notebooks for both
MERIT and Lynker Hydrofabric datasets. See [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md).

	abstract = {The National Water Model (NWM) is a key tool for flood forecasting, planning, and water management. Key challenges facing the NWM include calibration and parameter regionalization when confronted with big data. We present two novel versions of high-resolution (∼37 km2) differentiable models (a type of hybrid model): one with implicit, unit-hydrograph-style routing and another with explicit Muskingum-Cunge routing in the river network. The former predicts streamflow at basin outlets whereas the latter presents a discretized product that seamlessly covers rivers in the conterminous United States (CONUS). Both versions use neural networks to provide a multiscale parameterization and process-based equations to provide a structural backbone, which were trained simultaneously (“end-to-end”) on 2,807 basins across the CONUS and evaluated on 4,997 basins. Both versions show great potential to elevate future NWM performance for extensively calibrated as well as ungauged sites: the median daily Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of all 4,997 basins is improved to around 0.68 from 0.48 of NWM3.0. As they resolve spatial heterogeneity, both versions greatly improved simulations in the western CONUS and also in the Prairie Pothole Region, a long-standing modeling challenge. The Muskingum-Cunge version further improved performance for basins {\textgreater}10,000 km2. Overall, our results show how neural-network-based parameterizations can improve NWM performance for providing operational flood predictions while maintaining interpretability and multivariate outputs. The modeling system supports the Basic Model Interface (BMI), which allows seamless integration with the next-generation NWM. We also provide a CONUS-scale hydrologic data set for further evaluation and use.},

abstract = {Abstract Recently, rainfall-runoff simulations in small headwater basins have been improved by methodological advances such as deep neural networks (NNs) and hybrid physics-NN models—particularly, a genre called differentiable modeling that intermingles NNs with physics to learn relationships between variables. However, hydrologic routing simulations, necessary for simulating floods in stem rivers downstream of large heterogeneous basins, had not yet benefited from these advances and it was unclear if the routing process could be improved via coupled NNs. We present a novel differentiable routing method (δMC-Juniata-hydroDL2) that mimics the classical Muskingum-Cunge routing model over a river network but embeds an NN to infer parameterizations for Manning's roughness (n) and channel geometries from raw reach-scale attributes like catchment areas and sinuosity. The NN was trained solely on downstream hydrographs. Synthetic experiments show that while the channel geometry parameter was unidentifiable, n can be identified with moderate precision. With real-world data, the trained differentiable routing model produced more accurate long-term routing results for both the training gage and untrained inner gages for larger subbasins (>2,000 km2) than either a machine learning model assuming homogeneity, or simply using the sum of runoff from subbasins. The n parameterization trained on short periods gave high performance in other periods, despite significant errors in runoff inputs. The learned n pattern was consistent with literature expectations, demonstrating the framework's potential for knowledge discovery, but the absolute values can vary depending on training periods. The trained n parameterization can be coupled with traditional models to improve national-scale hydrologic flood simulations.},

	abstract = {Abstract The mapped rivers and streams of the contiguous United States are available in a geographic information system (GIS) dataset called National Hydrography Dataset Plus (NHDPlus). This hydrographic dataset has about 3 million river and water body reaches along with information on how they are connected into networks. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS) provides streamflow observations at about 20 thousand gauges located on the NHDPlus river network. A river network model called Routing Application for Parallel Computation of Discharge (RAPID) is developed for the NHDPlus river network whose lateral inflow to the river network is calculated by a land surface model. A matrix-based version of the Muskingum method is developed herein, which RAPID uses to calculate flow and volume of water in all reaches of a river network with many thousands of reaches, including at ungauged locations. Gauges situated across river basins (not only at basin outlets) are used to automatically optimize the Muskingum parameters and to assess river flow computations, hence allowing the diagnosis of runoff computations provided by land surface models. RAPID is applied to the Guadalupe and San Antonio River basins in Texas, where flow wave celerities are estimated at multiple locations using 15-min data and can be reproduced reasonably with RAPID. This river model can be adapted for parallel computing and although the matrix method initially adds a large overhead, river flow results can be obtained faster than with the traditional Muskingum method when using a few processing cores, as demonstrated in a synthetic study using the upper Mississippi River basin.},
