# Leakance: Groundwater-Surface Water Exchange

DDR models groundwater-surface water exchange via a **leakance term** ($\zeta$) that modifies the Muskingum-Cunge routing equation. This captures gaining and losing stream behavior driven by the hydraulic head difference between the stream surface and the regional water table.

## Physical Setup

The leakance formulation uses depth to water table from the ground surface (`d_gw`) as its groundwater state variable, following standard hydrogeology convention (Ma et al. 2026, Maxwell et al.).

```
        ground surface (datum = 0)
════════     ════════
        │   │           <-- h_bed = top_width / (2 * side_slope)
        │~~~│           <-- depth (flow depth from Manning's)
        │   │
════════╧═══╧════════   <-- channel bed
        . . . . . . .
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  <-- water table (d_gw below ground surface)
```

**Reference frame:**

- Ground surface is the datum (elevation = 0)
- Channel bed sits at elevation `-(h_bed)` below ground surface
- Stream surface sits at elevation `-(h_bed) + depth`
- Water table sits at elevation `-(d_gw)`

## Head Difference

The hydraulic head difference driving exchange is:

```
dh = stream_surface - water_table
   = (-h_bed + depth) - (-d_gw)
   = depth - h_bed + d_gw
```

Where:

- `depth` = flow depth from inverted Manning's equation [m]
- `h_bed` = channel incision depth from trapezoidal geometry [m]
- `d_gw` = depth to water table from ground surface [m]

The channel incision depth is estimated from existing trapezoidal channel geometry:

```
h_bed = top_width / (2 * side_slope)
```

## Sign Convention

| Condition | dh Sign | Zeta Sign | Stream Type |
|-----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Large `d_gw` (deep water table) | Positive | Positive | **Losing** (water leaves stream) |
| Small `d_gw` (shallow water table) | Negative | Negative | **Gaining** (water enters stream) |

### Losing Stream (deep water table)

```
        ground surface
════════     ════════
        │~~~│           <-- stream surface (high)
        │   │
════════╧═══╧════════   <-- channel bed
        .   .   .   .
        .   .   .   .   <-- unsaturated zone
        .   .   .   .
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  <-- water table (far below)

dh > 0  =>  zeta > 0  =>  water LOST from stream to aquifer
```

### Gaining Stream (shallow water table)

```
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  <-- water table (at/above ground surface)
════════     ════════   <-- ground surface
        │~~~│           <-- stream surface (low)
        │   │
════════╧═══╧════════   <-- channel bed

dh < 0  =>  zeta < 0  =>  water GAINED by stream from aquifer
```

## Zeta Equation

The full leakance term computed in `_compute_zeta()`:

```
zeta = A_wetted * K_D * (depth - h_bed + d_gw)
```

Where:

- `A_wetted = width * length` = wetted streambed area [m^2]
- `width = (p_spatial * depth)^q_spatial` = power-law width [m]
- `K_D` = hydraulic exchange rate [1/s] (Cosby PTF + KAN delta correction)
- `d_gw` = depth to water table from ground surface [m] (time-varying, daily; learned by LSTM)

Flow depth in `_compute_zeta()` is clamped to `depth_lb` (matching `_get_trapezoid_velocity()`) to prevent gradient singularities from `pow(~0, a<1)` at near-zero discharge.

## Modified Routing Equation

The leakance term enters the Muskingum-Cunge routing as:

```
b = C2 * (N @ Q_t) + C3 * Q_t + C4 * (q_prime - zeta)
```

Zeta is subtracted from `q_prime` inside the `C4` coefficient so that gradients
from the MC coefficients (which depend on velocity, which depends on Manning's n)
flow through to the leakance term. Positive zeta (losing) reduces the lateral
inflow contribution, decreasing downstream discharge. Negative zeta (gaining)
increases it, adding groundwater baseflow.

## Parameter Ranges

| Parameter | Range | Log-space | Description |
|-----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `K_D` | [1e-8, 1e-6] | No | Hydraulic exchange rate (1/s) |
| `d_gw` | [0.01, 300.0] | Yes | Depth to water table from ground surface (m) |

The `d_gw` range spans shallow alluvial aquifers (0.01 m) to deep bedrock settings (300 m), consistent with CONUS water table depth observations (Fan et al., 2013; Maxwell et al.).

## Changes Since Song et al. (2025)

The original leakance implementation (Song et al. 2025, Eq. 12-14) defined `d_gw` as the **height of the water table above the channel bed**, with the channel bed as the reference datum:

```
Old equation:  zeta = A_wetted * K_D * (depth - d_gw)
Old range:     d_gw in [-2.0, 2.0] m  (linear space)
Old reference: channel bed = 0
```

```
        │~~~│   <-- depth (flow depth, relative to channel bed)
        │   │
════════╧═══╧════  <-- channel bed (datum = 0)
        .   .
~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~  <-- water table at d_gw above channel bed
```

In that formulation:

- **Positive `d_gw`** (e.g. +1.0 m) = water table above channel bed. If `d_gw > depth`, then `depth - d_gw < 0` giving a gaining stream.
- **Negative `d_gw`** (e.g. -1.0 m) = water table below channel bed. `depth - d_gw` is always positive, giving a losing stream.

### Problems

1. **Negative `d_gw` is nonsensical as a "height"** -- the parameter was used as a signed offset relative to the channel bed rather than a true physical quantity.
2. **Range [-2.0, 2.0] m is far too narrow** -- real CONUS water table depths span 0 to 300+ meters below ground surface (Fan et al. 2013, Maxwell et al.).
3. **Wrong reference frame** -- hydrogeology convention measures water table depth from the ground surface, not from the channel bed. The channel bed's position relative to the ground surface was never accounted for.

### Current formulation

The updated equation explicitly computes where the channel bed sits relative to the ground surface using `h_bed = top_width / (2 * side_slope)` from existing trapezoidal geometry, then builds the head difference from a common datum (ground surface = 0):

```
New equation:  zeta = A_wetted * K_D * (depth - h_bed + d_gw)
New range:     d_gw in [0.01, 300.0] m  (log space)
New reference: ground surface = 0
```

This makes `d_gw` a proper physical quantity with a physically meaningful range, and the sign convention follows naturally from the geometry rather than from an arbitrary signed offset.

## Implementation

- **Core math**: `src/ddr/routing/mmc.py` -- `_compute_zeta()`
- **LSTM prediction**: `src/ddr/nn/leakance_lstm.py` -- produces daily `K_D` and `d_gw` from forcings + attributes
- **Config**: `src/ddr/validation/configs.py` -- `params.use_leakance`, `params.parameter_ranges`
- **Daily-to-hourly mapping**: In `MuskingumCunge.forward()`, `day_idx = (timestep - 1) // 24`
